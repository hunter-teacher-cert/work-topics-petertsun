In the manufacturing area, this article describe how companies are trying to use the technology of neural network to enable a manufacturing machine to learn by itself how to relate the process variables and the quality of the product produced by the manufacturing process. So far, companies are using expert human to teach a machine how to perform manufacturing tasks.

In the future, I think that there will will a mixture of human teaching the machine and machine using neural network to learn to teach itself some new skills or information.It is fascinating how a machine can be designed to learn some of human capabilities. I am pretty sure it is useful for producing high quality products. I just hope the machine does not learn to be so human-like that it goes on strike until the owners cave to the machines' demands.
